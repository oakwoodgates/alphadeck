"""The notify seam (slice C) — the PIPE is built; the DELIVERY is deferred (operator call, 2026-07-11).

``pipeline.daily`` detects MATERIAL TRANSITIONS — the state or verdict changed vs the PRIOR as-of's
call-of-record — and emits each through a ``Notifier``. "Material" is deliberately this compare and
nothing subtler: trigger churn, provenance reorders, and confidence drift all version the calls log
via ``record_if_changed`` without being transitions; a state/verdict move is the thing an operator
would want to be woken for (the calls-log material-change question, answered where it bites).

v1 ships ONE adapter: ``LogNotifier`` — a loud log line + the transitions block in the daily
summary. No email / push / webhook until the operator picks a channel; when they do, it is one new
adapter behind ``get_notifier()`` and zero rework in the cron. Inverse loudness (#7) lives in the
ADAPTER: the log notifier records every transition (a log is a record, not a nag); a future push
adapter filters to the loud ones (→ armed) and stays silent for the quiet states.
