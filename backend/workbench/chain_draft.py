"""The narrative→chain drafter's RESOLVER (Slice 5a) — the exact-membership decider.

S5 (the LLM decomposition, Slice 5b) proposes value-chain segments and the names that sit in them. A
proposed name is a **discovery suggestion, never a decision** (INVARIANT #2): the model's name/ticker is a
key, never an id. This module runs every proposed name through THIS tenant's security master and decides:

- **PLACED** — a unique EXACT ticker match OR a unique EXACT name match → the master row's ``security_id``
  is assigned (auto-place as a drafted member). Exact membership, never a fuzzy judgment.
- **AMBIGUOUS** — several / partial / token-only matches, OR a ticker/name CONTRADICTION (the exact ticker
  and the exact name resolve to DIFFERENT rows) → the operator PICKS from the candidates (each shown with
  ticker + CIK so a homonym is disambiguated by sight). A lone substring match is **deliberately here, not
  PLACED** — a token overlap is the homonym-trap heuristic ("$48B Oklo Technologies"), and auto-place must
  never rest on a judgment call.
- **ABSENT** — no master row → surfaced as "suggested, not in your universe", never guessed onto a ticker.

It is **read-only** (it never ingests, never writes) and it sources **no number**: a PLACED name is still
UNSCORED until the operator runs the existing extract→ratify loop on it. The eventual persistence is the
operator's promote (which re-checks membership — `app/routers/workbench.py`); nothing here touches the spine.

    on-screen tell for a colliding seed per #9: a placed name shows WHY it surfaced). Empty for an off-universe
    name resolved by the master rather than discovered by a term. Never a number (#3 — a keyword string).

    ``discovery_source`` records WHERE the name came from (provenance — INVARIANT #6): ``"edgar"`` = matched a
    CIK in the EDGAR-discovered universe; ``"off_universe"`` = resolved OUTSIDE that universe, via the
    sweep-augmented context. **It is NOT a hard claim the tail-sweep's web-search sourced the name** (``decompose``

    never "tail-sweep found this." Display-only like ``matched_terms``: never a number (#3), never promoted onto a
    ``BasketMember`` (#2). Defaults ``"edgar"`` (the conservative no-pill state) and is set ``"off_universe"`` in
    exactly ONE place — the ``_match_discovered_cik`` fork — so a stray construction can never over-claim.

    ``sector`` / ``exchange`` / ``listing_status`` / ``category`` are machine-parsed IDENTITY carried from the master (enriched
    just-in-time from EDGAR submissions before resolution) — display-only like ``matched_terms``: never a number
    (#3), never promoted onto a ``BasketMember`` (#2). ``listing_status`` is a LISTING-PRESENCE heuristic
    (``"active"`` / ``"inactive"``), NOT a delisting verdict: a PLACED name whose master row reads ``"inactive"``
    is DOWNGRADED to AMBIGUOUS (never auto-placed) with its own row as the single pick — a frictionless rescue,
    surfaced with a HEDGED flag ("no current listing found in EDGAR"), so a false-inactive costs one extra click,
    never a silent drop (#9). ``None`` when the row is un-enriched (the honest fallback — no flag, no gate).

    ``off_thesis`` surfaces the NARRATOR's already-made "this name doesn't fit the thesis" opinion as a bit (the
    ``prose`` is the why) — display-only like ``matched_terms`` / ``discovery_source``: never a number (#3), never
    promoted onto a ``BasketMember`` (#2), never on the call path. It RECOMMENDS, never removes: a flagged name
    STAYS placed (membership is deterministic exact-CIK, #2 / #9 — never a silent drop) with a ``remove`` the
    OPERATOR clicks (#10). Set at the narration MERGE (``app.routers.workbench.execute_draft``), not at resolution
    — so it defaults ``False`` on every construction path here. COVERAGE = reconciler-appended collisions (the
    unnarrated PLACED/VERIFY names the narration pass fills): the boilerplate-collision flood the flag exists to
    catch. The organizer's OWN placements carry prose and aren't re-judged — an organizer-placed off-thesis name
