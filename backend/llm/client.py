"""A thin, model-agnostic LLM client — the single place the app talks to the model API.

Mirrors the repo's ``EdgarClient`` idiom (``ingest/edgar/client.py``): live calls are explicit opt-in
(``allow_live``); the SDK is imported lazily inside the live path so the package imports — and the whole
test suite runs — with **no** ``anthropic`` installed and **no** API key. With ``allow_live=False`` or no key,
``draft_structured`` raises ``LLMUnavailable`` (the offline gate), which every caller turns into fail-open.

Interface is deliberately generic — ``draft_structured(system, user, tool) -> dict`` (one forced tool call,
its validated args returned), plus its auto-tool sibling ``research(system, user, tool) -> str`` (a web-search
pass → free-text synthesis, the Slice-1 research step) — so a different provider is a one-file swap. Prompts +
schemas live with the feature module (``llm/flag_explanation.py``, ``llm/chain_decomposition.py``), never here
(CLAUDE.md).
